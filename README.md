---

Authentication is a complex and exciting topic that involves using many of the concepts we've already studied as well as several new ideas. 

An authentication system allows the registration / signup of new users and allows those users to sign in. It has to be able to identify each user and keep their information private and secure.

Being able to develop secure user login systems is in fact a whole career and life path in and of itself, but understanding the broad concepts of **Auth** is critically import for all developers. 

Describing auth flow and understanding key terms are very common **interview questions** for junior developers, so lets take some time to research and understand auth and the related concepts.

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository and answer the questions as you research directly in the README. You do not have to pull request and submit this lab, but you will want to have it on hand for reference in the future. 

## Auth Concepts Worksheet

#### Define the following

1. *Authentication*
* Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system.

2. *Authorization*
* Authorization is a process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file. Authorization is usually coupled with authentication so that the server has some concept of who the client is that is requesting access.

3. Explain how *authentication* and *authorization* are related but distinct concepts.
* Authentication and authorization are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information. Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights.

5. *Sessions vs Token based auth*
* The main difference is session-based authentication of the connection stores the authentication details. The session method makes the server store most of the details, while in the case of the token-based one the client stores them.

* A session is a small file, most likely in JSON format, that stores information about the user, such as a unique ID, time of login and expirations, and so on. It is generated and stored on the server so that the server can keep track of the user requests. The user receives some of these details, especially the ID, as cookies that will be sent with every new request, so that the server can recognize the ID and authorize the user’s requests.
* Steps for session:
 - The user sends a login request to the server.
 - The server authenticates the login request, sends a session to the database,  and returns a cookie containing the session ID to the user.
 - Now, the user sends new requests (with a cookie).
 - The server checks in the database for the ID found in the cookie, if the ID is found it sends the requested pages to the user.

 * A token is an authorization file that cannot be tampered with. It is generated by the server using a secret key, sent to and stored by the user in their local storage. Like in the case of cookies, the user sends this token to the server with every new request, so that the server can verify its signature and authorize the requests. 
 * Steps for Token-based:
 - The user sends a login request to the server.
 - The server authorizes the login and sends a token to the user.
 - Now, the user sends a new request(with a token).
 - The server checks the token is valid or not, if the token is valid it sends the requested pages to the user.

6. *json web token (also know as a jwt)*
* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
* Used for Authorization : Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.
* three parts (header, payload, signature)

7. *Encoding, encryption and hashing* along with the uses for and differences between the three
* https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/encryption-encoding-and-hashing/#:~:text=Encoding%3A%20Reversible%20transformation%20of%20data,protect%20the%20confidentiality%20of%20data.

* Encoding data is a process involving changing data into a new format using a scheme. Encoding is a reversible process and data can be encoded to a new format and decoded to its original format.

* Hashing is a one-way process where data is transformed into a fixed length alphanumeric string. This string is known as a hash or message digest. A hash cannot be reversed back to the original data because it is a one-way operation. Hashing is commonly used to verify the integrity of data, commonly referred to as a checksum.

* Encryption is the process of securely encoding data in such a way that only authorized users with a key or password can decrypt the data to reveal the original. Encryption is used when data needs to be protected so those without the decryption keys cannot access the original data. When data is sent to a website over HTTPS it is encrypted using the public key type. While encryption does involve encoding data, the two are not interchangeable terms, encryption is always used when referring to data that has been securely encoded. Encoding data is used only when talking about data that is not securely encoded.

8. *oAuth* (pronounced oh-Auth)
* OAuth is a standard that apps can use to provide client applications with “secure delegated access”. OAuth works over HTTPS and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.
* open authorization - lets a third party handle the authentication transaction

#### Explore and then describe the following npm packages:

1. [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
 - industry standard package in node for handling hashing
2. [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)
 - implements full jwt standard
3. [passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)
    * also describe what a *strategy* is in the context of this npm package
 - middleware package for node, compatible with express
 - strategy - one specific middle provided by passport that authenticate in one way
 - next project - passport will replace our DIY middleware we will set up for project 3
